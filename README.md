# Agenda de Contatos

This **Contacts Agenda App** a comprehensive Android contacts agenda application, where I applied my knowledge in Android Studio and SQLite to create a complete CRUD system. The app allows users to add, view, update, and delete contacts efficiently. Leveraging SQLite ensures reliable local data storage, while Android Studio facilitates a seamless user interface for easy contact management.

This project exemplifies practical implementation of CRUD operations in Android, focusing on user experience and data handling best practices.
